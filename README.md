# Digital Asset Custody Solution

## Overview

This repository contains a secure blockchain-based digital asset custody solution designed for institutional and high-net-worth clients. The system provides enterprise-grade security for digital asset management through a comprehensive smart contract architecture that ensures proper authorization, access control, and auditability.

## Key Components

### Asset Registration Contract
Records essential details of all managed digital assets including ownership information, asset type, acquisition date, and valuation parameters. Supports various digital asset classes including cryptocurrencies, security tokens, and NFTs.

### Multi-Signature Authorization Contract
Implements an m-of-n approval mechanism requiring multiple designated parties to approve transactions before execution. Configurable thresholds based on transaction value, asset type, or other parameters provide customizable security.

### Access Control Contract
Manages permissions and privileges for different user roles within the system. Implements role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permission settings and emergency access protocols.
